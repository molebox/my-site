What the fuck is the Edge? What does that even mean? Edge of what? It's taken me a beat to fully grasp what it is, and even now,
with the ability to chat with some super sharp minds at work, I'm still not 100% sure I have a grasp of what it means.

I like to create mental models of things to help me understand their meaning. For me that means using analogies to help drive the message home.

Being able to replace the hard parts, with things that my brain can relate to helps me form a picture in my head and understand, the "thing".

## Simpler times

Before we attempt to figure out WTF the Edge is, let's roll it back a tad and cover what a Content Delivery Network (CDN) is. When you open your laptop and hit the internet to view your fav site, the browser (AKA the internet thing: Chrome, Firefox, etc) is going to make a request to a server.

Wait, what's a server Rich? Great question! A server is just a computer that provides a service to another computer. Think of it like this, you go to a restaurant and sit down for a fab steak. The server is the waiter you give your order too. They take your order, process it, then give you your steak.

In computer lingo, I give you, the four horsemen of the internet:

- You are the **client**
- The waiter is the **server**
- Your steak is the **request**
- The waiter delivers your steak as a **response**

In terms of a CDN, a server is one of many computers dotted around the globe and part of a network. So in our restaurant, every waiter is a server. They form a network of waiters, all waiting to take your order (request). The restaurant is the internet, and we are literally the clients!

When the restaurants menu is being given our to the waiters, they receive a set list of meals that can be on the menu and served to the clients. Each waiter has a section of the restaurant so that they are as close as possible to each table in their section.

- The waiters menu is made up of static assets, and we are deploying them to the CDN. They remember the items on the menu (**cached**)
- The waiters can _only_ serve the menu items to the clients - no adding more melted cheese to that bolognese
- But the waiters can serve you your food super quick, because they are close to you

The down side is that it's not dynamic, you can't make changes to your order!

## The Edge!

Ok, let's drop the analogies for a second. This is where we go into the weeds. What does Edge mean when we talk about a CDN?

In a nutshell it's compute close to the user. It's a server that operates on a globally distributed network, that can
