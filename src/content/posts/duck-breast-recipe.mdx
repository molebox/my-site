A simple yet delightfully sumptuous duck breast recipe.

## What's in the bag?

Duck breast. Sounds a bit luxurious, but it's actually quite simple. They come in different sizes, but in general are about the size of your hand with fingers and thumb together.

Hasselbackspotatis is a Swedish potato classic that can be done in a couple of ways, I like to keep it simple, but i recommend googling different techniques for cooking them.

Finally red wine sauce. I've often found that red wine sauce recipes found on the internet are a bit shit, and taste too much like wine. Mine is :chefs-kiss:

## Ingredients

**Main**

- 2 duck breasts, any size
- However many potatoes you are going to eat. About the size of a large puppies paw
- However many carrots you are going to eat
- Wedge of butter
- Pinch of rock salt
- Pinch of pepper

**Red wine sauce**

- 2 garlic cloves
- 400ml water
- 1 glass of red wine. I love a bit of Malbec, but use whatever you have on hand
- 1 onion
- 1 chicken stock cube
- Pinch of rosemary
- Half a carrot
- Wedge of butter
- Pinch of rock salt
- Pinch of pepper

## Step 1: Potatoes and carrots

Turn the oven on at 200 degrees. Next take the duck breasts out of their packaging and lay them on a board for later.

**Potatoes**

- Turn the potato on its side and slice a thin 2mm slice from the edge, this will act as the bottom of the potato and stop it rolling around
- Place the potato, sliced side down on a board, and with a sharp knife begin to cut into the potato around 10mm from the edge. If the potato is round it doesn't matter where you begin, if the potato is long, place it lengthways on the board and cut from the left _or_ right. Cut the potato around 3/4 down to the bottom. Each slice should be around 5mm apart. Continue until you have reached the other end of the potato

**Carrots**

- Cut the carrots into thirds. Then cut each piece in half and half again

**Shove them in the oven**

- On a large tray lay the potatoes and carrots out in a pattern. (Pattern optional). I like to drizzle a little olive oil over the carrots, if you do this make sure you don't get any on the potatoes.
- Take one of the wedges of butter and heat it up in the microwave or on the stove. Use one of those brush things to brush the potatoes with the butter.

The potatoes and carrots will take around 30 minutes. During this time, brush the potatoes with the melted butter. You will notice that the cuts you made start to flower out, this is what you want.

## Step 2: Prepare the duck

Whilst the potatoes and carrots are cooking in the oven, take a sharp knife and cut a cross hatch pattern through the duck skin. The trick here is to **not** cut the skin through to the meat. So your knife should be sharp, and your hand steady.

Next sprinkle a healthy portion of rock salt, and pepper over the duck. Leave the duck to rest.

## Step 3: The sauce

- Cut the onion into thin strips
- Crush the garlic cloves (skin on) with the edge of a knife
- Heat a frying pan over medium heat, and add the wedge of butter, onion and crushed garlic cloves
- Add the salt, pepper and rosemary
- Let it gently cook until the onion is soft.
- Waft the smell up your nose and proclaim yourself a master chef

While the onion mix is cooking, you can heat up the 400ml of water and add the stock. Once the onion looks ready (about 5 minutes), add the wine.
The goal here is the reduce the wine and boil off the alcohol. Take a glass for yourself if you're that way inclined.

The winey, onion mixture should start to become slightly think, when this happens add the water/stock mix and simmer.

## Step 4: The duck

If the potatoes have begun to flower, and you are out of butter, you can begin cooking the duck.

- Take another frying pan (preferably cast iron) and turn it on at it's lowest heat and add the duck breast skin side down. Salt and pepper the underside of the breasts (they are facing up).

This is the trick to cooking duck breast, you want to slowly raise the heat over the course of around 10 minutes. At it's highest point, the heat should be no more that 3/4 of full capacity.

- Using some of those fork pincher things, lift the breast to check it's underside every now and again. Look at the point between the skin and the meat. It should be around 4mm thick and the pan should be fizzling with juicy duck fat.
- Once the pan has been turned up to it's highest point (3/4 capacity), and the skin looks browned, you can flip it so the skin side is up.
- Give it around 3-5 minutes and flip the breasts again (they should now be skin side down)
- Take the potatoes and carrots out of the oven
- Add the duck to the oven. If you are not using a cast iron pan, transfer the breasts and their juices to another pan and add the pan to the oven.

Depending on how you like your duck breasts, and how fat they are, set a timer for between 6-8 minutes. As a general rule of thumb I've found that 8 minutes is the sweet spot.

## Step 5: Finishing the sauce

- Take a tight knit sieve and pour the sauce into a bowl
- Use a kitchen spoon to push down on the onion mix now in the sieve to release any juices back into the sauce
- Return the sauce to the empty frying pan on a low heat

The next step depends on how you like your sauces. If you like them thin then you are good to go! If you're like me, and you like them thicker then proceed with the following steps:

- Take a small glass and fill it half way up with water. Now glasses are different sizes in different houses, but you are looking for a glass that is about 4 inches tall
- Add a table spoon of four to the water and stir until you have a paste
- Using a sieve, pour the four mixture through the sieve, into the sauce
- Turn up the heat and stir constantly until the sauce is thick and creamy

## Step 6: Put it all together

Once your alarm rings, take the duck breasts out of the oven and lay them on a board to rest. After around 8-10 minutes, use a super sharp knife and cut the breasts at an angle, around an inch thick. Plate up the duck, potatoes, carrots and sauce.

## Step 7: Enjoy

Pull up a pew, pour yourself a glass of your favorite tipple, and enjoy your fabulous duck breast!
